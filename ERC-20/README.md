# MarToken ERC20 Smart Contract

This repository contains a simple implementation of an **ERC20 token** called **MarToken**. The contract is written in Solidity and follows the ERC20 standard, which is widely used for creating fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.


## Overview

The **MarToken** contract is a basic ERC20 token implementation that includes the following functionalities:

- **Token Creation**: The contract allows you to create a new token with a specified initial supply.
- **Token Transfers**: Users can transfer tokens to other addresses.
- **Allowances**: Users can approve other addresses to spend tokens on their behalf.
- **Events**: The contract emits events for transfers and approvals.

## Features

- **ERC20 Compliance**: Fully compliant with the ERC20 token standard.
- **Custom Errors**: Uses gas-efficient custom errors for better error handling.
- **Simple and Clean Code**: Easy to understand and modify for your own use case.
